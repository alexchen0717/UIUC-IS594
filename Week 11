Project Update: AWS Serverless Text-to-Speech Converter
Progress This Week: Polly Integration and End-to-End Workflow Testing
Polly Integration for Text-to-Speech Conversion

Successfully integrated Amazon Polly to convert text files into speech:
Configured the ListFiles Lambda function to send selected file content along with the chosen voice parameter to Amazon Polly.
Set up Polly to generate audio output and store it in the S3 bucket for playback or download.
Confirmed that Polly accurately processes text files and produces high-quality audio in the desired format.
End-to-End Workflow Testing

Conducted comprehensive testing of the entire system to validate the complete user workflow:
Verified that users can upload a text file, select a voice, convert the text to speech, and download or listen to the audio file.
Tested the interactions between the frontend and backend components, including S3, API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and Polly, ensuring smooth and accurate data flow.
Addressed minor issues discovered during testing, such as response delays and formatting inconsistencies, to improve the user experience.
Challenges Encountered
Optimizing the Polly response format to ensure compatibility with the frontend audio playback.
Debugging issues related to data flow between components to maintain reliable and efficient service across all AWS integrations.
