Project Update: AWS Serverless Text-to-Speech Converter
Progress This Week: DynamoDB Integration Testing and Frontend-Backend Finalization
DynamoDB Integration Testing
Successfully tested the integration between Lambda functions and DynamoDB to ensure that:
File metadata (file ID, name, timestamp, and status) is accurately stored in DynamoDB upon file upload.
File listing and deletion operations interact correctly with DynamoDB, updating and retrieving data as expected.
Monitored CloudWatch Logs for troubleshooting and verification, confirming that the Lambda functions handle DynamoDB queries efficiently and without errors.
Finalizing Frontend Interaction with Backend
Completed the frontend JavaScript setup to interact seamlessly with API Gateway endpoints:
File upload, file listing, and file deletion functionalities are now fully integrated and operational.
The voice selection dropdown is now connected to the GetVoices Lambda, allowing users to choose voices dynamically retrieved from Amazon Polly.
Verified that users can upload a file, select a voice, and see the file list update in real-time.
Challenges Encountered
Ensuring that frontend AJAX requests were correctly configured to handle API Gateway responses, especially with CORS settings.
Fine-tuning Lambda function response formats to provide meaningful feedback to the frontend for user interactions.

Next Steps to Complete the Project
Polly Integration for Text-to-Speech
Finalize the connection between the selected text files and Amazon Polly:
Modify the ListFiles Lambda to send selected file content and voice parameters to Polly for text-to-speech conversion.
Ensure the resulting audio file is stored in S3 and made available for download or playback on the frontend.
