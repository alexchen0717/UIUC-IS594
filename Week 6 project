1. Create an AWS Account 

2. Set Up IAM Roles and Permissions

Create an IAM Role that has the necessary permissions to interact with Amazon Polly, S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.
Ensure that the role allows Lambda to assume the necessary policies for these services.

3. Create an S3 Bucket for Frontend and File Storage

Create two S3 buckets:
Frontend: This bucket will store your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS).
FileStore: This bucket will store the uploaded files from the users.
Enable static website hosting on the Frontend bucket.
4. Set Up Amazon Polly

Familiarize yourself with Amazon Polly.
Set up Polly to be ready for integration with Lambda, using the AWS console to experiment with different voices and languages.
